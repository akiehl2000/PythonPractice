# Practice Python Notebooks

This is a repository I set up to house mini Python projects I undertake to hone my skills with Python and associated packages like Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, MatPlotLib, SciKitLearn, TensorFlow, and SciPy. While I have a reasonable level of experience with those skills, I wish to become as comfortable in Python and I am currently in R. I envision that the majority of projects featured here will have a dataset sourced from Kaggle and a reasonably brief anaylsis contained in a Jupyter notebook. 

## Projects

* `Job Placement:` A classification problem asking whether or not job candidates received employment given a set of descriptive metrics. Logistic regression, LDA, KNN, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and SVM model were fit. A random forest model was ultimately selected with a test accuracy of 88.4%.
